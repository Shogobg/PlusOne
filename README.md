## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to know which words are not English in my text so I can improve my English.

## Details

- A word will be considered as non-English word if it does not exist in this list: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremy-rifkin/Wordlist/master/master.txt

## Constraints

- The English word check logic needs to happen on the backend side.
- The frontend needs to be written in ReactJS.
- The backend can be written in Ruby or Javascript or Typescript. The web framework can be chosen freely.
- Any additional libraries are also allowed.
- Git needs to be used as a version control system.
- It needs to be done by November 6th. The repository can be shared on Github/Gitlab (publicly or privately with username dyoxyne).

## Evaluation criteria

- Correctness: Does it work as expected?
- Code quality: Is it readable and well structured?

## Bonus

- The solution is deployed on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Herokuâ€¦).
